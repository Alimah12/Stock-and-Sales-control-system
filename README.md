# Stock-and-Sales-control-system
I developed an inventory and sales management system to optimize operations and improve user experience. The backend uses C# with .NET, and the UI is built with Windows Forms. MySQL manages the database. Features include a cashier screen with multiple payment methods, efficient stock management, and detailed customer records.
